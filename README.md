# LocationInformationAPI
My solution to the following coding challenge, completed in around 6 hours: 


Create a .NET Web API that takes ZIP-code as a parameter, then outputs city name, current temperature, time zone, and general elevation at the location with a user-friendly message. For example, “At the location $CITY_NAME, the temperature is $TEMPERATURE, the timezone is $TIMEZONE, and the elevation is $ELEVATION”. Include documentation with any necessary build instructions and be prepared to discuss your approach.

Use the Open WeatherMap current weather API to retrieve the current temperature and city name. You will be required to sign up for a free API key.
Use the Google Time Zone API to get the current timezone for a location. You will again need to register a “project” and sign up for a free API key * with Google.
Use the Google Elevation API to retrieve elevation data for a location.
